        <div class="card-text"><b>Sunset.</b> Sunsets are reliably beautiful subjects and backgrounds for photography. Even when they’re not colorful and
            majestic, they still create a lovely change in lighting, which can make boring scenes look suddenly magical.
            But sunsets can also be frustrating, especially for beginners. When a sunset is particularly gorgeous, you
            can feel discouraged trying to capture its full beauty in an image. Below are some tips and inspiration to
            help you tackle this problem and improve your sunset photography.</div>

        <img src="./images/002.jpg" class="card-img" alt="Green Forest">
        <div class="card-text"><b>Green Forest.</b> In the forest I breathe in every way that it is possible to expand: in lungs, in brain in soul. In the forest
            there is a sense of kinship with the flora, of an ancient soul that stretches into everything that lives. It
            is here under the nascent rays of a sun born to rise each day that I am so very alive. How could I not love
            the forest so? From simple seed, with mud, water and sun, comes all this, these towering gentle giants that
            are so anchoring to all that I am.</div>

        <img src="./images/003.jpg" class="card-img" alt="Lake">
        <div class="card-text"><b>Lake.</b> The lake lay silver in the bright light of the noon sun, not a perfect ovoid like a looking glass of old, but
            irregular like an ink-splat on aging concrete. The rippled water ran right into the crevices, washing the soil
            from the rocks. Around the edges were pines, chaotic in their spacing but never more than a few feet without
            a tree. The only sound was the soft whispering of the trees and Ryan's legs splashing as he pulled the kayak
            into the cool water at the northern bank. To the southern side it looked an easy journey in a couple of hours,
            but he knew better than most that the headwind would add on at least another hour and
            tire him more than paddling double the distance on a still day.</div>

    <div class="card">
        <img src="./images/004.jpg" class="card-img" alt="Summer Sun">
        <div class="card-text"><b>Summer Sun.</b> The ground swerved into the narrow valley that was almost a gorge , it ran for around ten miles before sloping
            back up. From here we could see herds of cattle swarming through the narrow corridor of the valley and small
            shrubs growing on the sides. The forest had been the heart of this world but now we were in the soul. This was
            our freedom.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <img src="./images/005.jpg" class="card-img" alt="Sunflowers">
        <div class="card-text"><b>Sunflowers.</b> They are bright and cheery, and as warm and inviting as the sweet summer sun. With brilliant yellow petals,
            also known as “rays,” sunflowers have an unmistakable sun-like appearance that has made them a crowd favorite,
            especially in the summer months.</div>

        <img src="./images/006.jpg" class="card-img" alt="Mirror Lake">
        <div class="card-text"><b>Mirror Lake.</b> The mountains were covered with a rug of trees, green, yellow, scarlet and orange, but their bare tops were
            scarfed and beribboned with snow. From carved rocky outcrops, waterfalls drifted like skeins of white lawn,
            and in the fields we could see the amber glint of rivers and the occasional mirror-like flash of a mountain
            lake.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <img src="./images/007.jpg" class="card-img" alt="Green Valley">
        <div class="card-text"><b>Green Valley.</b> In this expanse of green there are more hues than anyone has ever named, yet here they are for any eye to see.
            The land rolls as it always has, as if it feels that time and space are one thing, that it rolls through the
            ages as much as to the horizon. Over it is laid a path, one that branches through the open landscape, and as
            I begin to walk there is a frisson of joy for all the choices to come, each one of them laden with discoveries.</div>

        <img src="./images/008.jpg" class="card-img" alt="Tulips">
        <div class="card-text"><b>Tulips.</b> What was only green a week before has become a garland of the most vibrant blooms. They are colours to weave
            dreams from, as soft and gay as any silk. How they come from earth, sunshine and rain feels akin to magic,
            even though the science is well known. The older I become, the more I see the miracle they are, better than
            any picture or movie could be.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <img src="./images/009.jpg" class="card-img" alt="Mountains">
        <div class="card-text"><b>Mountains.</b> If the earth had a pulse it rose through the mountains, creating their bold silhouette. To my eye, their peaks
            are the green line of a doctor's graph. I saw those rocks at dawn, those slopes that give home to so much life,
            a foundation for trees and shrubs, grass and ferns. With blue above and below, in the sky and lake, ever
            lightening as the sun rose, I knew it would be a good day... I just knew.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <img src="./images/010.jpg" class="card-img" alt="Summer Valley">
        <div class="card-text"><b>Summer Valley.</b> The sunrise is the warmest hues of the rainbow, the colours that bring a gentle passion to the soul. It is the
            calling of the skies to rise and be something great, a new person that is revealed to me daily as I work to
            become my best self.</div>

    <div class="card">
        <img src="./images/011.jpg" class="card-img" alt="Green Road">
        <div class="card-text"><b>Green Road.</b> Desolate country road, pot holes, dirt track, lined with hedges, tree lined, loose gravel, narrow, open road,
            like a black ribbon over the highlands, disappearing into the horizon where earth meets big sky, endless river
            of black, baked in the August sun, draped over the mountains like orange peel, sheer drop to one side.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card">
        <img src="./images/012.jpg" class="card-img" alt="Stone Bridge">
        <div class="card-text"><b>Stone Bridge.</b> It arched elegantly over the clear blue river. At first glance, the river seemed serene and peaceful, but
            underneath the surface were violent currents that would whisk away anyone who dared touch it. The stone bridge
            was the only way to cross it. It had been built by the men of ancient times.</div>
